![AI Images Browser main UI](assets/screenshot-hero-grid.webp)

## What is AI Images Browser?

**AI Images Browser** is a **local image browser and manager** focused on AI-generated images.
It scans your folders, parses metadata from popular tools (Automatic1111, ComfyUI, Fooocus, SD.Next, Forge, SwarmUI, DrawThings) and online services like Midjourney / Nijijourney, whenever their metadata is present in the files, and lets you search, filter and organize your images by prompt, model, sampler, seed and more - all **offline**, on your machine.

It is open-source (MPL 2.0) and free to use.

> _Previously known as **"Image MetaHub"**._

## Auto-Watch: Real-time folder monitoring

Image MetaHub can automatically monitor your output folders and detect new images in real-time as they're generated:

- **Individual folder toggles** - Enable/disable watching per directory with eye icon
- **Real-time detection** - Instant image detection using intelligent file monitoring
- **Background processing** - Silent updates without notifications or interruptions
- **State persistence** - Watchers automatically restored on app restart
- **Multiple formats** - Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, and WEBP
- **Smart filtering** - Automatically filters cache folders and system directories

Perfect for monitoring ComfyUI or Automatic1111 output folders during active generation sessions.

---

## Smart Library: Clustering, auto-tags, and dedup (beta)

The Smart Library groups similar images into stacks using prompt similarity, so you can browse variations together and manage large libraries faster.

- **Clustering stacks** - Background worker builds stacks from prompt similarity with progress updates and cached results
- **Collections sidebar** - Filter stacks by model and auto-tag collections
- **Auto-tags** - TF-IDF suggestions from prompts and metadata, with promote-to-tag and removal workflows
- **Dedup helper (beta)** - Suggests best vs archived images in a stack and estimates disk space savings

---

## Metadata support

Image MetaHub parses metadata from:

- Stable Diffusion / Automatic1111 images (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- ComfyUI (**full coverage** with [MetaHub Save Node](https://github.com/skkut/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save) - [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/image-metahub/nodes/imagemetahub-comfyui-save); partial coverage for legacy workflows)
- Fooocus
- SD.Next
- Forge
- SwarmUI
- DrawThings
- Online services like Midjourney / Nijijourney (when prompts/settings are saved into the downloaded files)
- Other tools that store generation parameters in PNG/JPG/WebP metadata

> **New in v0.12.0 - Smart Library + Auto-Tags:** Image MetaHub can now cluster similar prompts into stacks, generate TF-IDF auto-tags, and surface dedup suggestions for large libraries.
>
> **NEW in v0.11.0 - Official MetaHub Save Node for ComfyUI:** We've released an [official companion custom node](https://github.com/skkut/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save) ([ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/image-metahub/nodes/imagemetahub-comfyui-save)) designed specifically for Image MetaHub. This node guarantees full metadata compatibility by auto-extracting all generation parameters and saving them in both A1111 and Image MetaHub formats.
>
> For legacy ComfyUI images without MetaHub Save Node, Image MetaHub attempts to parse metadata from standard workflow formats, though coverage may vary depending on custom nodes and workflow complexity.

### Enhanced MetaHub Save Node Integration

When using the MetaHub Save Node, Image MetaHub automatically provides:

- **Auto-import tags** - Tags from `imh_pro.user_tags` are automatically imported for filtering
- **Notes display** - Notes from `imh_pro.notes` shown as read-only metadata
- **Performance metrics** - GPU analytics including VRAM usage, generation time, steps/second, and system versions
- **Verified telemetry badges** - Visual badges and filters for images with verified performance data
- **LoRA weights** - Complete LoRA information with weights (e.g., "style_lora_v1.safetensors (0.8)")

If a tool writes prompt / settings in a consistent way, Image MetaHub can usually read it. The parsers are extensible and can be updated as new formats appear.

## Automatic1111 integration (Pro)

With Pro enabled, Image MetaHub can talk directly to a running Automatic1111 instance with full-featured generation controls:

- **Model and LoRA selection** - Browse and select from your installed models and LoRAs with search filters
- **Image size controls** - Set custom width and height for generation
- **Smart model memory** - "Remember last selected model" automatically selects your previously used model
- **Full parameter control** - Adjust prompts, negative prompts, CFG scale, steps, and seed
- **Real-time progress** - Live generation tracking with step-by-step progress updates

Basic setup:

1. Enable the API flag in your A1111 setup (`--api`).
2. Configure the A1111 endpoint in Image MetaHub settings.
3. Use "Generate with A1111" from image details / context menus.

For step-by-step instructions, see the dedicated docs in this repo.

## ComfyUI integration (Pro)

With Pro enabled, Image MetaHub can generate variations of your images by sending workflows directly to your ComfyUI instance via API with complete workflow-based generation.

**Requirements:**

- ComfyUI running locally (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8188`)
- [MetaHub Save Node](https://github.com/skkut/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save) installed in ComfyUI - [Get it on ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/image-metahub/nodes/imagemetahub-comfyui-save)
  - Official companion node released with v0.11.0
  - Ensures full metadata preservation for generated images
- [MetaHub Timer Node](https://github.com/skkut/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save) (included with Save Node, for accurate timing metrics)

**How It Works:**

1. Select any image in Image MetaHub with generation metadata
2. Click "Generate with ComfyUI" from the image details panel
3. Customize generation parameters (prompt, seed, steps, CFG, etc.)
4. Image MetaHub creates a simple txt2img workflow from the metadata
5. Workflow is sent to ComfyUI via `POST /prompt` API
6. **Real-time WebSocket-based progress tracking** during generation
7. Generated images are automatically saved by MetaHub Save Node with full metadata

**Key Features:**

- **Full parameter customization** - Model, LoRAs, seed, steps, CFG, image size
- **Real-time progress tracking** - Live WebSocket updates during generation
- **Copy workflow JSON** - Export workflow to clipboard for manual tweaking
- **Unified generation queue** - Track both A1111 and ComfyUI jobs in one sidebar
- **Queue management** - Cancel, retry, remove items, clear finished/all jobs
- **Automatic metadata preservation** - MetaHub Save Node ensures all generation data is saved

**Important: The workflow doesn't need to match your original workflow.**

Image MetaHub creates a **basic txt2img workflow** from the extracted metadata. This means:

**Preserved Parameters:**

- Positive and negative prompts
- Model name (checkpoint)
- Seed, steps, CFG scale
- Sampler and scheduler
- Image dimensions (width/height)

**Not Preserved (Advanced Features):**

- ControlNet inputs and preprocessing
- Upscalers and high-res fixes
- Refiner models and switch points
- Custom node configurations
- Multi-stage workflows
- Advanced LoRA configurations beyond basic weights

**Generated Workflow Structure:**

The generated workflow is a simple linear pipeline:

```
CheckpointLoader -> MetaHub Timer -> CLIPTextEncode (positive/negative)
                                    |
EmptyLatent -> KSampler -> VAEDecode -> MetaHub Save Node
```

The **MetaHub Timer** node is automatically included to ensure accurate `generation_time_ms` and `steps_per_second` metrics in your variation images.

**Why This Approach?**

This simplified workflow approach ensures:

- Reliable generation from any source image (A1111, ComfyUI, Fooocus, etc.)
- Consistent parameter extraction across different formats
- Compatibility across different ComfyUI setups and versions
- Fast workflow execution with minimal overhead
- No dependency on complex custom nodes

**Setup:**

1. Enable ComfyUI API (enabled by default, runs on port 8188)
2. Install MetaHub Save Node in ComfyUI:

   **Via ComfyUI Manager (Recommended):**
   - Search for "ImageMetaHub Save Node" in ComfyUI Manager
   - Or visit [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/image-metahub/nodes/imagemetahub-comfyui-save)

   **Manual Installation:**

   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/skkut/ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save.git
   cd ImageMetaHub-ComfyUI-Save
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure ComfyUI endpoint in Image MetaHub settings
4. Test connection and start generating variations

**Use Cases:**

- **Quick variations** - Modify prompts and regenerate with different seeds
- **Parameter testing** - Experiment with different CFG scales, steps, samplers
- **Seed exploration** - Generate multiple variations of a composition you like
- **Model comparison** - Use the same prompt with different checkpoints

**Recommendations:**

- Use "Generate with ComfyUI" for creating quick variations with modified prompts/seeds
- For advanced workflows (ControlNet, upscaling, multi-stage), manually load your full workflow in ComfyUI and adjust parameters there
- The generated workflow serves as a starting point that you can enhance in ComfyUI with additional nodes

## Compare panel (Pro)

The compare panel lets you:

- Pin multiple images and inspect them side-by-side
- Use synchronized zoom and pan to align details across images
- View prompts and key generation settings for each image at the same time
- **Toggle between Standard and Diff views** - Intelligent difference highlighting with word-level diff for prompts
- **Smart field comparison** - Automatically detects differences in models, LoRAs, seeds, CFG, steps, sampler, and clip skip
- **Neutral visual design** - Subtle highlighting for differences without intrusive badges
- Study subtle differences between variations (lighting, composition, models, seeds, etc.)
